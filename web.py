st.subheader("In recent years, social media has become deeply embedded in modern life. While these platforms provide entertainment and a sense of connection, they also raise serious concerns about mental well-being, identity, and self-worth. Our project examines these issues by analyzing data from a Kaggle dataset and visualizing key patterns in behavior and psychology. We focus on the effects of prolonged social media use, particularly regarding distraction, self-esteem, and the need for validation. The following figures explore the complex relationship between digital habits and mental health indicators‚Äîincluding attention disorders, emotional reliance on online engagement, and comparison-driven dissatisfaction.\n\n\n\n\n\n")

st.header("Beyond the Data: A Human Perspective:")
st.subheader("While our analysis focuses on measurable trends in mental health and social media use, the broader cultural shifts driven by technology deserve equal attention. Modern platforms are carefully designed to capture and monetize attention, often leading to compulsive use, unhealthy comparisons, and declining self-worth. People curate idealized versions of their lives online, creating distorted perceptions of reality that can leave others feeling inadequate. Algorithms, optimized for engagement rather than well-being, reinforce echo chambers and push sensational content, shaping how users think, feel, and interact. As virtual interactions increase, genuine human connection and spontaneous social moments diminish. What emerges is a cycle where distraction, disconnection, and emotional fatigue become normalized. This highlights the need for conscious, mindful engagement with digital platforms‚Äîand a re-centering of human values in an increasingly algorithm-driven world.")
st.header("CONCLUSION")
st.subheader("Our analysis reveals a clear pattern: excessive social media use is linked to lower self-esteem, increased distraction, and a growing reliance on external validation. Behaviors like 'doom scrolling' reflect a cycle where users seek comfort from the very platforms that contribute to their distress. "
    "While some bias may exist‚Äîsuch as pre-existing mental health conditions in participants‚Äîthe overall trends suggest that platform design plays a significant role in shaping emotional and cognitive well-being. "
    "Ultimately, the findings highlight the need for greater awareness around how digital habits affect mental health. As Gen Z continues to navigate an online world optimized for engagement, fostering healthier, more intentional use of social media is essential."
