st.subheader("in recent years, social media has become an integral part of daily life, especially for members of modern society. While platforms offer entertainment and connectivity, they also raise serious concerns about mental well-being, identity, and self-worth. Through our analysis of kaggle data and corresponding visualizations, we explored the psychological effects of prolonged social media usage, with a particular focus on patterns of distraction, self-esteem, and the search for validation. The following figures uncover nuanced relationships between social behaviors and mental health indicators‚Äîranging from attention disorders to emotional reliance on digital engagement.\n\n\n\n")

st.header("CONCLUSION")
st.subheader("From the data and figures analyzed, a clear pattern emerges: excessive social media use is closely tied to increased distraction, lowered self-esteem, and a cycle of seeking validation from the very sources that provoke insecurity. Several figures show overlapping trends, reinforcing correlations between restlessness, ADHD tendencies, and emotional instability. However, potential dataset skew‚Äîhighlighted in Figure 5‚Äîreminds us that many participants may have entered the study with existing psychological conditions, which could amplify the observed effects. Still, this doesn‚Äôt undermine the larger implication: Gen Z's relationship with social media is both psychologically complex and deeply affected by platform design. The rise of doom scrolling, in particular, appears not only as a byproduct of digital fatigue but also as a contributing factor to it‚Äîcreating a loop of disengagement, comparison, and cognitive overload. Ultimately, these findings underscore the urgent need for awareness, digital literacy, and healthier interaction with social technology.")
